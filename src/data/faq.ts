  { question: "What is Dubio?", answer: "Dubio is an AI-powered video dubbing platform that lets you translate and dub your videos into 50+ languages while preserving your original voice, tone, and emotion. Our technology uses advanced voice cloning and lip sync to create natural-sounding dubs in minutes.", category: "General" },
  { question: "How does AI dubbing work?", answer: "Our AI pipeline works in four steps: First, we transcribe your original audio using state-of-the-art speech recognition.

Finally, we apply lip sync to match the dubbed audio with the video.", category: "General" },
  { question: "What types of content can I dub?", answer: "You can dub virtually any video content including YouTube videos, podcasts, online courses, corporate training videos, marketing content, social media clips, documentaries, and more. Our platform supports videos from a few seconds to several hours in length.", category: "General" },
  { question: "How long does dubbing take?", answer: "Most videos are dubbed within 2-5 minutes, depending on length and complexity. Longer videos or those with multiple speakers may take slightly longer. You'll receive a notification when your dubbed video is ready.", category: "General" },
