      "Yes! Every new account gets 1 free minute to try Subtitle Only, Dubbing Only, or Dubbing + Subtitles. No credit card required.",

  {
    question: "What counts as a minute?",

      "Billing is based on the duration of your input video, rounded up to the nearest minute. A 90-second video counts as 2 minutes. Processing the same video into multiple languages counts separately for each language.",
